## About
This is one of the first projects I built when I first started learning Python. It's a simple local multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game, made with OOP.

The Tic Tac Toe board is numbered like a <b>keyboard numpad</b>, as shown below:

The players take turns to draw their symbol on the board, by choosing a number corresponding to the desired location.

## Getting Started
Running the game is very simple, you only <b>need to have Python installed.</b>

### Linux
First, download tictactoe.py or clone the repository by typing

    git clone https://github.com/Gabrieliima15/TicTacToe.git

on the terminal. Then use

    cd TicTacToe

to open the folder with the terminal. Now, you can just type

    python tictactoe.py
    
and you're good to go. Have fun!

### Windows
First, download the repository using the 'Download ZIP' option on GitHub.

Before running the game, I <b>Highly recommend</b> that you do these simple steps first:

After downloading, extract the files and open tictactoe.py with any text editor (can be notepad, for example). Then, locate the part that says

    _ = system('clear')
   
change it to

    _ = system('cls')
    
and save the file.

Now, you can run the game. To do so, open CMD and navigate to the folder you just downloaded:

    cd Downloads/TicTacToe-main/TicTacToe-main
    
Then, use

    python tictactoe.py
   
and you're good to go. Have fun!
